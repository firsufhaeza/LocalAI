The book is divided into four parts: Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Modern Physics. Each part consists of several chapters that introduce the concepts, formulas, and examples of physics in a clear and concise way. The book also includes numerous exercises, problems, and self-tests to help students practice and review their understanding of physics. The book is praised for its pedagogical approach, its relevance to life science topics, and its use of SI units.
 
Kane Sternheim Physics is available in both print and digital formats. The print version can be purchased from various online retailers or borrowed from libraries. The digital version can be downloaded as a PDF or an EPUB file from the Internet Archive[^1^] [^2^], a non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more. However, the digital version has some limitations, such as a 14-day loan period and a one-hour access time per session.
